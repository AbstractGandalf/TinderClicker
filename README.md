A Script to automate clicks on Tinder


You need to install the pynput library for this script using pip.

To stop the clicking process, move the cursor to the extreme top right of the screen or wherever the cursor's position has a tuple value of (1365,0) Lol don't get mad at me.

Enjoy and Happy Tindering
P.S This is very effective only if you have Tinder Plus ( To get unlimited likes )
